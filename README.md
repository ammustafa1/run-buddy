Launched: https://ammustafa1.github.io/run-buddy/

Thoughout this project I used very basic foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS to create an interactive landing page for a hypothetical company called "Run Buddy" that matches avid runners with personal trainers. I was abble to utilize basic HTML and CSS webpage structures as well as more advanced CSS functions such as media queries and flexbox.

Technologies used:
